The job seeker needs to determine whether they should apply for the job, so it’s important to be clear and concise. Read the qualifications from the job seeker perspective and ask these questions:

*	Are the qualifications specific?
*	Are they described appropriately at each grade level?
*	Are you using plain and simple language?

This section will:

*	Automatically use a bulleted list format for each "qualification".

<h4><span class="fa fa-check"></span> Do</h4>
<h5>Only include content that the job seeker needs</h5>
* Only include information about qualifications - don’t include background checks, job locations, etc.
* Use the qualifications from [OPM’s Qualifications Standards Handbook](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/classifying-general-schedule-positions/) as a guide when writing the job announcement, but make sure to use plain language.
* Include education requirements, if there are any.
* Include how to substitute education for experience, if needed.

<h5>Organize the content logically</h5>
* Use clear subheadings to separate qualifications that everyone needs vs. qualifications that are specific to each grade level (if hiring at different grade levels).
* Keep sentences short — don’t list multiple qualifications in one sentence. Instead, break them up.

<h5>Write like you’re speaking to the job seeker</h5>
* Use language the job seeker knows—simpler is better!
* Use the active voice—the active voice is concise, direct and makes it clear who is doing the action or who is supposed to be doing the action. Using the active voice makes the content easy to understand. An active voice sentence follows this order: Subject + Verb + Object
* Use pronouns (i.e. address the audience as “you”, “your”) – this helps personalize the experience.
* Avoid internal jargon and acronyms—if an acronym is necessary, spell it out the first time it’s used. Refer to the [Plainlanguage.gov](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/) list of simple words and phrases.
* Use "must" instead of "shall" when qualifications are required. For example, "You must have at least one year of experience...".

<h4><span class="fa fa-times"></span> Do Not</h4>
* Don’t use dehumanizing terms like “incumbent”, "selectee", or “candidate”.
