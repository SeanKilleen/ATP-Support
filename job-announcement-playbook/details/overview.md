## Title bar - Current fields

### Job title

The name of the job.

The job title is the first thing a job seeker will see in their search results. Make sure it’s easy to understand and descriptive of what the job is.

#### Required
Yes

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__container">
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do">
  <h4><span class="fa fa-check"></span> Do</h4>
  * Only include the job title.
  * Use plain language.
  * Spell check your titles and your job announcement. Your TAS may provide this capability.
</div>
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do-not">
  <h4><span class="fa fa-times"></span> Do Not</h4>
  * Do not include play plan, series, grade or any other information that is available elsewhere in the job announcement.
  * Do not include additional information in parenthesis.
</div>
</div>

#### Myth: Job announcement titles are dictated by policy and must follow a specific format.

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__container">
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do">
  <h4>OPM Policy</h4>
  <p>
    Organizational and functional titles do not replace official position titles, they complement them. Agencies may establish organizational and functional titles for internal administration, program management, or similar purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Examples of organizational titles are Branch Chief or Division Chief. Examples of functional titles are Chief of Network Management and Director of Policy Development.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do-not">
  <h4>Impact</h4>
  <p>
    If job seekers don’t understand the job title, they are less likely to read the job announcement. For example, job titles that use grade levels or series numbers are confusing and can be misleading.
  </p>
  <p>
    Job announcements should include a job title that best describes the position, attracts candidates, and makes the job easier to find. For example, titling a job “Java Developer” instead of “APPSW” makes it easier for job seekers to understand.
  </p>
</div>
</div>

## Agency modal - Current fields

The Agency modal is a small window that pops up over the screen to focus the user's attention on a task. It opens when the user clicks on:

* The agency name in the [title bar](#title-bar---current-fields)
* The **Learn more about this agency** button in the [Duties](../duties/) section.
* The **Learn more about this agency** link in the Agency contact information component of [How to apply](../how-to-apply)

### Agency Marketing Message

This text appears in the lead paragraph of the agency modal and allows the agency to communicate what the agency does to the job seeker.

This field was not shown unless the Agency Marketing URL was also present. That is no longer the case.

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__container">
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do">
  <h4><span class="fa fa-check"></span> Do</h4>
  * Explain what the agency does.
  * Explain what the specific unit does that this job will exist within.
</div>
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do-not">
  <h4><span class="fa fa-times"></span> Do Not</h4>
  * Do not copy the mission statement of the agency. Job seekers can find that information on your web site and many will view your site if they are serious about applying. Also, mission statements often do not convey to an outsider what the agency does.
  * Do not summarize the job. That should be done in the [Duties](../duties#summary) summary section.
</div>
</div>

### Agency contact information

This information holds the contact information and address where applicants can reach the agency. It includes phone, TDD, email, and address.

### Marketing URL

Allows the agency to provide a URL to their careers page or other page that they deem appropriate that will be included at the bottom of the modal window.


## Previous fields

### Announcement number

The announcement number has moved to the [actions section](../how-to-apply#actions) which lives in the right-hand sidebar. We moved it to give it a consistent and relevant home, it is more relevant to the applicant once they have decided that this job may be worth applying to (thus the placement near the apply button), and to cull the number of items found in the Overview section.

### Control number

The control number has moved to the [actions section](../how-to-apply#actions) which lives in the right-hand sidebar. We moved it to give it a consistent and relevant home, it is more relevant to the applicant once they have decided that this job may be worth applying to (thus the placement near the apply button), and to cull the number of items found in the Overview section.

### Series

The series has moved to a new section, [Similar jobs](../similar-jobs/), that lives between Duties and Requirements and contains the series and a list of similar occupations. We moved series after a card sort and a usability test with non-Federal employee job seekers where they discovered they did not know what a series referred to. We worked with this group to ensure that the label "Job family (Series)" was clear and provided more context.

We also moved series because we have a problem we are trying to address which you read more about in [Similar jobs](../similar-jobs/)
