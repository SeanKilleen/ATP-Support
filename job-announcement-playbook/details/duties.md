#### Recent change

With the 6.5 release we moved Promotion Potential out of the [Overview](../overview/) section into Duties. We did this for serveral reasons:

1. We conducted several rounds of card sorting with job seekers. Promotion Potential scored in the bottom half along with announcement and control number which also moved out of the Overview section.
2. It allowed us to reduce the amount of information in the Overview section making the information that remains there more effective (readable and retainable).
3. It allowed us to chunk the Promotion Potential with Supervisory status.

## Previous fields

### Relocation Authorized

The relocation authorized field has moved to the [locations section](../locations#relocation-expenses-reimbured) and renamed to "Relocation expenses reimbursed". We found in research that seekers were searching for this information when evaluating whether or not they would need to move to apply to this position and thus the Location section was a more logical placement.

### Telework eligible

The Telework eligible field has been given a permanent home in the [locations section](../locations#telework-eligible). We found in research that seekers were searching for this information when considering their commute. We also found that seekers struggled to find the information as it is currently found in 4 sections: Duties, Key requirements, qualifications, and the job title. Giving it a fixed location will help seekers find this information.
