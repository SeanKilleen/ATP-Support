## Current fields

### Summary

Summarizes what is unique about this job and lists the duties of the job.

The job summary is important to help job seekers understand what is unique about this job and why the job exists.

#### Required
Yes

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__container">
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do">
  <h4><span class="fa fa-check"></span> Do</h4>
  * Write a concise one or two sentence summary.
  * Use the position description and job analysis to help write the duties.
  * Use language the job seeker knows and be concise—simpler is better!
  * Avoid internal jargon and acronyms—if an acronym is necessary, spell it out the first time it’s used.
</div>
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do-not">
  <h4><span class="fa fa-times"></span> Do Not</h4>
  * Do not use the job summary to discuss the mission statement of the agency. Agencies may now use the [Agency pop-up window](../overview#agency-modal---current-fields) to convey details about the agency and link to your careers page.
  * Don’t use dehumanizing terms like “incumbent” or “candidate”.
  * Do not repeat other sections of the job announcement in the summary section (who may apply, et. al.). Duplicating information does NOT emphasize that information but, instead serves to clutter the announcement. Duplicated information confuses and overwhelms job seekers.
  * Do not center paragraphs or provide HTML formatting. This negatively impacts the readability of the job announcement.

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__myth">
#### Myth: Job announcements are marketing tools for agencies

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__container">
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do">
  <h4>OPM Policy</h4>
  <p>
    This myth is both true and false. While this is not policy, we recommend that job announcements focus on the job, not the agency. Job seekers conduct independent research about agencies they are interested in.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do-not">
  <h4>Impact</h4>
  <p>
    Our research shows that job seekers care more about the job details than the agency mission in their immediate job search. We recommend that job announcements focus on advertising the job itself, and that agency details and branding be kept on agency pages.
  </p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

### Responsibilities

Lists the duties the applicant will be expected to perform.

**NOTE:** This is a new field and may not yet be offered by your Talent Acquisition System (TAS). Work with your vendor in order to be able to use this field. This field may still be named **Major Duties** in your TAS in which case it will:

* Not automatically use bullets though you may continue to provide content via bullets.

#### Required
Yes

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__container">
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do">
  <h4><span class="fa fa-check"></span> Do</h4>
  * Use the position description and job analysis to help write the duties.
  * List each duty as a separate bullet.
  * Describe the day-to-day responsibilities of the job — be specific and include typical projects, resources or technologies that the job will use.
  * Prioritize the duties — put the most important duties first.
  * Use action verbs to start each bullet, such as “Lead”, “Manage”. Refer to the [Plainlanguage.gov](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/) list of simple words and phrases.
  * Capitalize the first word of each bulleted item.
  * Include punctuation at the end of each bulleted item.
  * Use language the job seeker knows and be concise — simpler is better!
  * Avoid internal jargon and acronyms—if an acronym is necessary, spell it out the first time it’s used.
</div>
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do-not">
  <h4><span class="fa fa-times"></span> Do Not</h4>
  * Don’t make the duties section overwhelming — a list of 20 duties is too much. Instead, prioritize the most important duties.
  * Don’t use dehumanizing terms like “incumbent” or “candidate”.
  * Don’t repeat duties.
</div>
</div>

#### Examples

Some example responsibilities that have previously appeared in other sections of the job announcement:

* Incidental driving: Tells the applicant they may need to operate a vehicle as part of their duties.
* Physical requirements: Tells the applicant they may need to life a certain weight to fulfill their duties.
* Uniform: Tells the applicant they may have to wear a uniform to fulfill their duties.

Be sure to also review the [Optional responsibilities](#optional-responsibilities) section towards the bottom of this page.

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__myth">
#### Myth: If using a standard Position Description (PD), HR specialists aren’t allowed to include specialized skills in the job announcement

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__container">
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do">
  <h4>OPM Policy</h4>
  <p>
    You can include specialized skills in your job announcement. Position descriptions outline the occupational series and grade level of a position in accordance with OPM classification standards. The job analysis identifies the critical competencies and defines the specialized experience and skills needed to perform the work of the position. HR and the hiring manager should collaborate to conduct the job analysis and use the results to develop the job announcement.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do-not">
  <h4>Impact</h4>
  <p>
    The job announcement should reflect the specific duties and requirements of a role. Providing specific detail about the job helps job seekers determine if they are qualified for a job and understand what the role entails. When a job seeker fully understands the position, they are able to make an informed decision about whether or not to apply.

[Read more about travel percentages](https://www.usajobs.gov/Help/how-to/search/filters/travel-percentage/).

#### Required
Yes

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__container">
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do">
  <h4><span class="fa fa-check"></span> Do</h4>
  * You must enter a value—if the job requires no travel, enter “Not required”.
  * Only enter one value.
  * May include supplemental text to explain the type of travel, such as two weeks of training.  
</div>
</div>


### Supervisory status

This tells the job seeker  if job requires supervising others.

Options include:

*	Yes
*	No

#### Required

Yes

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__container">
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do">
  <h4><span class="fa fa-check"></span> Do</h4>
  *	You must enter a value — don’t leave it blank.
</div>
</div>

### Promotion Potential

This tells the job seeker if there’s an opportunity to move up in the grade level.

#### Required
Yes

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__container">
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do">
  <h4><span class="fa fa-check"></span> Do</h4>
  * Always enter a value—enter “No” if there is no promotion potential
  * Enter the highest GS level of the potential job promotion.
</div>
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do-not">
  <h4><span class="fa fa-times"></span> Do Not</h4>
  * Do not repeat this information elsewhere.
</div>
</div>

#### Recent change

With the 6.5 release we moved Promotion Potential out of the [Overview](../overview/) section into Duties. We did this for several reasons:

1. We conducted several rounds of card sorting with job seekers. Promotion Potential scored in the bottom half along with announcement and control number which also moved out of the Overview section.
2. It allowed us to reduce the amount of information in the Overview section making the information that remains there more effective (readable and retainable).

### Who May Apply

Use this section to list who is eligible to apply to the job. We also use the text in this section to auto-populate the [**This job is open to**](../this-job-is-open-to) section. This section is only available if your TAS does not offer the hiring path multi-select option.

#### Required
Yes, if your TAS does not offer the hiring path multi-select option. 

This section does not appear if your TAS uses the hiring path multi-select option.


<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__container">

</div>

#### Prerequisites

However, there are new sections in the job announcement for these ‘prerequisites’. See the guidelines below to know where to put information that should not be in the Who May Apply.

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__myth">
#### Myth: You have to be a career employee to apply for merit promotion jobs

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__container">
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do">
  <h4>OPM Policy</h4>
  <p>
    Federal employees under a career- conditional or career appointment can apply to merit promotion jobs. Eligible veterans can apply for merit promotion jobs under the Veteran Employment Opportunity Act (VEOA).
  </p>
</div>
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do-not">
  <h4>Impact</h4>
  <p>
    Job seekers, including federal employees, don’t understand their eligibility and need more upfront clarification. Lack of clarity around eligibility increases the number of ineligible applicants that apply for a given job. Including information that is not related to eligibility but instead belongs in another section further confuses applicants.
  </p>

</div>


## Optional responsibilities

List any optional responsibilities in the Duties section.

### Hazardous conditions warning

Tells the applicant that they may be near hazardous conditions on the job.

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__suggested-text">
<h5>Suggested text</h5>
May be required to wear protective gear (i.e. Tyvek Suit and respirator).

  <h4><span class="fa fa-times"></span> Do Not</h4>
  * Don’t include this text in **Other Requirements** or **Additional Information** or anywhere else other than Responsibilities.
</div>
</div>

## Previous fields

### Relocation Authorized

The relocation authorized field has moved to the [locations section](../locations#relocation-expenses-reimbured) and renamed to "Relocation expenses reimbursed". We found in research that seekers were searching for this information when evaluating whether or not they would need to move to apply to this position and thus the Location section was a more logical placement.

### Telework eligible

The Telework eligible field has been given a permanent home in the [locations section](../locations#telework-eligible). We found in research that seekers were searching for this information when considering their commute. We also found that seekers struggled to find the information as it is currently found in 4 sections: Duties, Key requirements, qualifications, and the job title. Giving it a fixed location will help seekers find this information.
