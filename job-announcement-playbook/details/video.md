lead: The video field is an optional field you can use in the job announcement. It offers a space for the hiring agency to post a video about the job, the office and workplace environment or the agency and its mission.  The video needs to tell a story that inspires job seekers and motivates them to apply to the job.

## Do

* Offer a ‘day-in-the-life’ view of the job—interview current employees and describe the role and expectations.
* Give a glimpse of the agency culture, values and mission.
* Include images of the office space and how employees interact with each other.
* Consider talking about benefits.
* Keep it conversational.
* Keep the video under two minutes. 90 seconds is ideal.
* Use closed captioning or subtitles for accessibility issues. 
* Include contact information or a way to learn more about the agency.

## Do Not

* Include videos that don’t speak to the job or the agency. For example, don’t include videos that only talk about the career field.
* Include more than two videos—we recommend only one video, but you can post up to two. The system will not allow you to post more than two.
* Repeat the job description word for word.
