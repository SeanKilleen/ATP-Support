<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__suggested-text">
A career with the U.S. Government provides employees with a comprehensive benefits package. As a federal employee, you and your family will have access to a range of benefits that are designed to make your federal career very rewarding.

Eligibility for benefits depends on the type of position you hold and whether your position is full-time, part-time, or intermittent. Contact the hiring agency for more information on the specific benefits offered.

### Agency benefits

This text allows the agency to describe benefits that they offer above and beyond the standard Federal government benefits. If your agency has it’s own benefits page, you can add a link to that page.
