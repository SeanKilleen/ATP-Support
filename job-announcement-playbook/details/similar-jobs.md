This is a new section that attempts to address a specific problem:

Over 50% of all traffic to USAJOBS comes from domains external to USAJOBS and our bounce rate out of job announcements is high. In other words, over half of our users come from Google or another outside source directly to a job announcement, view the announcement for an average of 106.5 seconds, and then a majority of those users leave the site entirely.

We observed, over several usability tests, seekers evaluating the job announcement by reading the overview and duties section. By that point in reading the announcement seekers were making a decision to move on or not. Thus given our bounce rate we want to provide navigation to similar jobs in case this job is not an ideal fit for this applicant. Both the series link and occupation buttons take the user to search results that will provide them with other options.

As with all changes we'll monitor the impact of this change using analytics and continued testing with job seekers.

### Job family (Series)

Tells the applicant the job family, or category, that the job belongs to. The codes and titles for the job family are the [OPM Occupational Series](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/#url=List-by-Occupational-Series). The job family link directs the user to the search results page where the results are filtered by that series.

#### Required
Yes

### Occupations

Occupations are automatically added by our system. We have mapped many of the Department of Labor's [Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) codes](https://www.bls.gov/soc/) to OPM Occupational Series. We use these SOC codes and titles and our own search engine to search for those titles in the body of the job announcements posted to USAJOBS. Thus the more often you use an occupation title in your job announcement the more likely it will be tagged with that occupation. Each job announcement is tagged with relevant occupations.

The occupation buttons each show the SOC occupation title and the number of jobs tagged with that occupation. Clicking on the buttons will take the user to the search results page where the results are filtered by that occupation.

### Mission critical code

The mission critical code is a ‘tag’ we use to identify a job that is a “Mission Critical Occupation”. 

We created tags for these seven Mission Critical Occupations: 

1. Cyber Security
2. Data Scientist
3. Economist
4. Privacy
5. Program/Project Management
6. Grants Management
7. STEM

#### What are Mission Critical Occupations?

Mission Critical Occupations (MCOs) are roles that OPM has identified as being in high demand or critical to an agency’s mission. So far, OPM has identified seven MCOs, that may exist across multiple series, or don’t align with any series.

#### Why use Mission Critical Occupation Tags?

Tagging a job announcement with the right tag(s) helps:

* Elevate the job in search results.
* Increase the job visibility to job seekers.
* Make it easier for job seekers to search for and identify jobs that are a good match for their skill sets and experience.


#### Next Steps

MCO tags are currently available to agencies that use USA Staffing or Monster. We encourage you to start using the MCO tags in your job announcements. In the coming months, we will add these seven MCO tags to the USAJOBS keyword autocomplete.  We will also boost relevant, tagged job announcements in the search results. 

If your agency uses a different TAS and you have questions about the availability of MCO tags, please reach out to your agency TAS representative.

#### Required
No

**NOTE:** This is a new field and your Talent Acquisition System (TAS) may not offer it yet. Work with your vendor to start using this field. USAJOBS currently doesn’t display these tags in the job announcement, but we will support this feature soon.
