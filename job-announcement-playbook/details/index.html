    </h2>
    <p class="usa-font-lead">
      In this section we detail each component of the job announcement: What information is expected in that section, what has moved elsewhere, and which information is required.
    </p>
    <h3>What's new</h3>
    <p>
      The changes made with the 6.6 release are based upon the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>6 months of user research with job seekers, HR specialists, hiring managers, and OPM Policy conducted in 2015.</li>
      <li>Weeks of research with HR specialists and hiring managers culminating in an experience map for those roles.</li>
      <li>Several co-design sessions with HR specialists and Talent Acquisition System (TAS) vendors in The Lab at OPM.</li>
      <li>7 weeks of focused research with job seekers including card sorts and usability tests of functional prototypes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Based on the knowledge gathered during this research we have a set a new course for revising the job announcement.
