We have established our Hiring Paths as an enumerated list that your Talent Acquisition System (TAS) vendor can use in the future to allow you to select valid options without having to supply text. Talk to your vendor about this feature.

#### Example

This example shows all of the possible hiring paths. No single job would feature all of these.

### Second announcement

If this job is also open in another announcement to other hiring paths then this section will appear directly below the **This job is open to**. It contains the text "This job is also open in another announcement to" and then lists the other hiring paths. Clicking on this will open a new tab or window, which depends upon the preference of the user set in their browser, with the second announcement.
