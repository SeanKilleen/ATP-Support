  <h2>What agencies need to know about login.gov and USAJOBS.gov</h2>
  <h3>What is login.gov?</h3>

  <p>login.gov is a service that offers secure and private online
  access to government programs, such as federal benefits, services and
  applications. With a login.gov account, you can sign into multiple government
  websites (that are using login.gov) with the same email address and password.</p>

  <h3>Why is USAJOBS using login.gov?</h3>

  <p>login.gov uses two-factor authentication and stronger password criteria, that meet new <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards of Technology</a> requirements for secure validation and verification. By using login.gov, you will get an extra layer of security to help protect your USAJOBS profile against password compromises.</p>

  <h3>What will happen to my USAJOBS profile information?</h3>

  <p>Nothing will happen to the information stored in your USAJOBS
  profile.  You will keep all of your applications, saved searches and saved
  jobs.</p>

  <p>Once you set up a login.gov account, we’ll link it back to your
  USAJOBS profile. Whenever you come back to USAJOBS, you’ll use your login.gov
  email address, password and security code to sign into USAJOBS.</p>

  <h3>What do USAJOBS users need to do?</h3>

  <p>Once USAJOBS starts using login.gov, you will need to create a login.gov account, if you don’t already have one. login.gov will walk you through each step of the account set-up.  It’s a simple process, but here are a few things to know:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You’ll only need to create the login.gov account once.</li>
    <li>You’ll need to enter an email address to start the account set up­–you need to use the same email address that you use for USAJOBS (either your primary or secondary email address).</li>
    <li>You’ll need a working phone number (mobile or landline), because login.gov will send you a security code.</li>
    <li>You’ll use your login.gov email address, password and security code, every time you want to sign into USAJOBS.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Once you finish setting up your login.gov account, you’ll go back to USAJOBS to finish linking your USAJOBS profile to your login.gov account.</p>

  <h3>What if a USAJOBS user already has a login.gov account?</h3>

  <p>If you already have a login.gov account, you don’t need to create a second one. Use your existing login.gov email address and password, plus the security code to sign into USAJOBS.</p>

  <h3>How is USAJOBS letting their users know about the change?</h3>

  <h4>Nov. 20 - Two weeks before we switch to login.gov</h4>
  <p>We are emailing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All users that we’re changing the sign in process soon. We don’t mention ‘login.gov’, but we encourage users to sign into USAJOBS to make sure their information is up-to-date.</li>
    <li>All USAJOBS account holders who use a .mil, .gov or .edu email address that we’re changing the sign in process soon and we recommend they update their primary email to use a personal (non-government) email address.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Dec. 4<sup>th</sup> - The day we switch to login.gov</h4>
  <p>We are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Emailing all users that we’re now using login.gov and will give them a specific call-to-action to create a login.gov account or use an existing login.gov account to sign into USAJOBS.</li>
    <li>Updating content on USAJOBS.gov to talk about the switch to login.gov including:
      <ul>
        <li>A 'create login.gov account' message near the <b>Sign In</b> link—this will include a link to the login.gov transition page.</li>
        <li>A transition page—all users will see the transition page when they try to sign into USAJOBS. The page routes users to login.gov to create a new account, or sign in using an existing account.</li>
        <li>Updated Help Center to point to login.gov help content where necessary.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Where can I send users for more information or help?</h3>
  <h4>Why we’re using login.gov or what users need to do</h4>
  <p>Send users to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>https://www.usajobs.com/help/faq/account/login-gov/</strong> - What is login.gov and why do I have to create an account? This is an FAQ that explains what login.gov is, why we’re using it and other questions.</li>

  <h4>Passwords or signing into login.gov</h4>
  <p>Users will no longer manage their passwords on USAJOBS.gov—they now must <b>manage their password at login.gov.</b></p>

    <li><strong>Do not send users to the USAJOBS Help Desk</strong> if they are having issues with their password, security code or any other problems with their login.gov account.</li>
  </ul>
