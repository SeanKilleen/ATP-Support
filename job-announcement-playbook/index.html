    Welcome to the job announcement playbook
  </h2>
  <p class="usa-font-lead">
    This site is for anyone who is involved in creating a job announcement. Our goal is to make the job announcement easier to read and understand. Improving our job announcements will help our job seekers find the job(s) they’re looking for and help our agencies hire the best talent available.
  </p>
  <p>
    The job announcement guideline site will help you:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Get the latest updates to USAJOBS and the job announcement.</li>
    <li>Learn what you must include (and what’s optional) in the job announcement.</li>
    <li>Get guidance and best practices on creating an ideal job announcement.</li>
    <li>Learn how other agencies are improving their job announcements.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You’ll still need to create your job announcement in your Talent Acquisition System (TAS).
