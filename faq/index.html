    <h3>How do I reset my ATP password?</h3>
    <p>
      If you’ve forgotten your password or locked your account due to multiple incorrect password attempts, you can reset your password from the ATP Sign-In page. Select ‘Forgot your username or password’ and enter your federal email address into the text box. You will be sent a ‘Reset Password’ email. You can then create a new password.
    </p>

    <h3>Why does my ATP account lock me out? When that happens, how do I unlock it?</h3>
    <p>
      ATP accounts are locked after 35 days of inactivity. If your account is locked due to inactivity, email your Agency Administrator and he/she can unlock your account. If you do not have an assigned Agency Administrator/do not know your Agency Administrator, email <a href="mailto:recruiter-help@usajobs.gov">recruiter-help@usajobs.gov</a> to request account access.
    </p>

    <h2 class="usajobs-recruitment__section-header">Agency Talent Portal</h2>
    <h3>Can I use the Agency Talent Portal (ATP)?</h3>
    <p>
      If you are an Agency Hiring Manager, HR Specialist, or Recruiter, you have the ability to use ATP as a recruitment service. Your agency administrator or the USAJOBS Program Office will help you to create an ATP account. If you do not know who your agency administrator is, contact the USAJOBS Program Office <a href="mailto:recruiter-help@usajobs.gov">recruiter-help@usajobs.gov</a> for further information. Once you are given permission to utilize ATP, then you can use all the tools within ATP.
    </p>

    <h3>Where do I start?</h3>
    <p>
      ATP has been redesigned to support multiple workflows and to embrace integrated features as they become available.
    </p>
    <p>
      The starting point is up to you. ATP’s most used feature is Resume Mining, which allows HR users and hiring managers to discover qualified job seekers who have made their resumes searchable in their USAJOBS account. Resume Mining can be accessed from anywhere in ATP by clicking the “Search” button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Campaigns are a new feature which allows for recruitment teams to share lists of job seekers and collaborate together when reviewing job seekers.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can start by searching nearly one million up-to-date resumes, finding interesting job seekers, creating a campaign from the search results, and then sharing the campaign with your recruitment team. Or you can create a campaign, add your colleagues, establish a framework for reviewing job seekers, and then search for talent. The choice of method is up to you and your recruitment team.
    </p>

    <h3>How should I not use ATP?</h3>
    <p>
      ATP is a recruitment tool; it is not a hiring tool. Merit system principles, as well as any applicable other laws and policies, must be followed. Just like normal, you cannot search for job seekers and bypass the application process. In the event that you are doing a direct hire through a special hiring authority, it is important to obtain Qualifications from HR before making job offers.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the AUP?</h3>
    <p>
      The Acceptable Use Policy outlines the guidelines and regulations which an Agency Talent Portal account holder must comply with to use the ATP. Any violation of these policies can result in disciplinary action by your agency and/or revocation of your ATP account.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I invite one of my co-workers to use ATP?</h3>
    <p>
      If a member of your team would benefit from ATP, or you would like to share a campaign with a fellow Hiring Manager, HR Specialist, or Recruiter who doesn’t yet have access to ATP, direct them to your agency administrator or the USAJOBS Program Office (<a href="mailto:recruiter-help@usajobs.gov">recruiter-help@usajobs.gov</a>). Once they have been vetted, they will be granted access to ATP.
    </p>

    <h2 class="usajobs-recruitment__section-header">Campaigns</h2>
    <h3>What is a campaign?</h3>
    <p>
      A campaign is a project, resource, or organizational structure that can be used to collect, track, and organize job seekers of interest in ATP. It has the flexibility to represent anything you need it to. Some examples of ways campaigns can be used are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a collection of job seekers to call by a certain date</li>
      <li>a collection of job seekers of a certain profession</li>
      <li>a collection of job seekers in a certain location</li>
      <li>a collection of job seekers you want your co-worker to reach out to</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How do I set up a campaign?</h3>
    <p>
      To set up a campaign, go to “Campaigns” in the top navigation and then click “Add a Campaign”.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I save job seekers to campaigns?</h3>
    <p>
      You can always find job seekers by conducting a search and then clicking on the job seeker's name to go to their user detail page. This page will show you more information about the job seeker you are interested in, including their resume. You’ll see an “Add to Campaign” button that will allow you to save the job seeker to any campaign you’d like, or create a new campaign to add them to.
    </p>

    <h3>What is a list?</h3>
    <p>
      A list is found within a campaign, and it is a smaller collection of job seekers that can be organized in any way that makes sense to you. You can name lists any way you’d like, such as by date, job title, or different stages of a workflow.
    </p>

    <h2 class="usajobs-recruitment__section-header">Resume Mining</h2>
    <h3>Why do job seekers’ resumes expire? Where do job seekers with expired resumes go?</h3>
    <p>
      Job seekers have to actively choose to make their resumes searchable within USAJOBS in order to be active ATP job seekers. This is why not all USAJOBS account holders are ATP job seekers. Job seekers with expired resumes may have forgotten to make their resumes searchable, or it is possible their searchable resumes may have expired. Searchable resumes expire every 18 months.
    </p>
    <p>
      For now, ATP does not display expired resumes, so you might see job seekers there one day, and gone the next. We are working on a way to show you whose resumes are no longer available in your campaigns and lists so you can keep track of the job seekers you are interested in.
    </p>

    <h2 class="usajobs-recruitment__section-header">Events</h2>
    <h3>What are events?</h3>
    <p>
      Events within ATP allows you to submit all kinds of events - everything from a hiring fair to a virtual training event - to ATP to be posted on USAJOBS <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/Notification/Events/">here</a>. Just fill out the form with your event information, and it will get posted to USAJOBS once it is reviewed and approved.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I create an event?</h3>
    <p>To create an event, click the “Create an event” button on the Events page in ATP.</p>

    <h3>How can I use events?</h3>
    <p>
      You can use events to advertise hiring and training events that you and your agency are want to further promote through USAJOBS. It is especially valuable to post events here that target job seekers specifically, since they are the primary audience of USAJOBS.
    </p>
    <h3>I submitted my event, and now it says it is “in review”. What does that mean?</h3>
    <p>
      “In review” means that your event has been successfully submitted and is now being reviewed by the USAJOBS team. If it is approved, it will be published.
    </p>

    <h3>Why was my event disapproved?</h3>
    <p>
      Events are disapproved by the USAJOBS team when they do not follow the event submission guidelines that ensure all events are written in a format that is reflective of the language USAJOBS uses to ensure all content is user-friendly and in <a href="http://www.plainlanguage.gov/">plain language</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>What are the event submission guidelines?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Your event title should clearly state the federal agency hosting the event.</li>
      <li>Your event description should start off by stating who the event is open to in order to ensure the right people are engaged in your event content.</li>
      <li>Make sure you are writing in <a href="http://www.plainlanguage.gov/">plain language</a> and use terminology that your audience will clearly understand. </li>
      <li>Use spell check to ensure there are no grammar or spelling errors.</li>
      <li>Try to avoid using acronyms, and wherever possible, spell them out so job seekers can clearly understand what you are referring to.</li>
      <li>Try to make your content appealing to your audience, the job seeker - think about what information would be important for them to see at the time.</li>
      <li>If possible, add contact information for people who are interested in the event but cannot attend. </li>
    </ul>
