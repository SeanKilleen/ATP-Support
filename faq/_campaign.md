### What is a campaign?

A campaign is a project, resource, or organizational structure that can be used to collect, track, and organize job seekers of interest in ATP. It has the flexibility to represent anything you need it to. Some examples of ways campaigns can be used are:

* a collection of job seekers to call by a certain date
* a collection of job seekers of a certain profession
* a collection of job seekers in a certain location
* a collection of job seekers you want your co-worker to reach out to

### How do I set up a campaign?

To set up a campaign, go to “Campaigns” in the top navigation and then click “Add a Campaign”.


### How do I save job seekers to campaigns?

You can always find job seekers by conducting a search and then clicking on the job seeker's name to go to their user detail page. This page will show you more information about the job seeker you are interested in, including their resume. You’ll see an “Add to Campaign” button that will allow you to save the job seeker to any campaign you’d like, or create a new campaign to add them to.


### What is a list?

A list is found within a campaign, and it is a smaller collection of job seekers that can be organized in any way that makes sense to you. You can name lists any way you’d like, such as by date, job title, or different stages of a workflow.
