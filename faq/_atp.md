### Can I use the Agency Talent Portal (ATP)?

If you are an Agency Hiring Manager, HR Specialist, or Recruiter, you have the ability to use ATP as a recruitment service. Your agency administrator or the USAJOBS Program Office will help you to create an ATP account. If you do not know who your agency administrator is, contact the USAJOBS Program Office <a href="mailto:recruiter-help@usajobs.gov">recruiter-help@usajobs.gov</a> for further information. Once you are given permission to utilize ATP, then you can use all the tools within ATP.

### Where do I start?

ATP has been redesigned to support multiple workflows and to embrace integrated features as they become available.

The starting point is up to you. ATP’s most used feature is Resume Mining, which allows HR users and hiring managers to discover qualified job seekers who have made their resumes searchable in their USAJOBS account. Resume Mining can be accessed from anywhere in ATP by clicking the “Search” button.

Campaigns are a new feature which allows for recruitment teams to share lists of job seekers and collaborate together when reviewing job seekers.

You can start by searching nearly one million up-to-date resumes, finding interesting job seekers, creating a campaign from the search results, and then sharing the campaign with your recruitment team. Or you can create a campaign, add your colleagues, establish a framework for reviewing job seekers, and then search for talent. The choice of method is up to you and your recruitment team.

### How should I not use ATP?

ATP is a recruitment tool; it is not a hiring tool. Merit system principles, as well as any applicable other laws and policies, must be followed. Just like normal, you cannot search for job seekers and bypass the application process. In the event that you are doing a direct hire through a special hiring authority, it is important to obtain Qualifications from HR before making job offers.


### What is the AUP?

The Acceptable Use Policy outlines the guidelines and regulations which an Agency Talent Portal account holder must comply with to use the ATP. Any violation of these policies can result in disciplinary action by your agency and/or revocation of your ATP account.


### How do I invite one of my co-workers to use ATP?

If a member of your team would benefit from ATP, or you would like to share a campaign with a fellow Hiring Manager, HR Specialist, or Recruiter who doesn’t yet have access to ATP, direct them to your agency administrator or the USAJOBS Program Office (<a href="mailto:recruiter-help@usajobs.gov">recruiter-help@usajobs.gov</a>). Once they have been vetted, they will be granted access to ATP.
