### What are events?

Events within ATP allows you to submit all kinds of events - everything from a hiring fair to a virtual training event - to ATP to be posted on USAJOBS <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/Notification/Events/">here</a>. Just fill out the form with your event information, and it will get posted to USAJOBS once it is reviewed and approved.

### How do I create an event?

To create an event, click the “Create an event” button on the Events page in ATP.

### How can I use events?

You can use events to advertise hiring and training events that you and your agency are want to further promote through USAJOBS. It is especially valuable to post events here that target job seekers specifically, since they are the primary audience of USAJOBS.

### I submitted my event, and now it says it is “in review”. What does that mean?

“In review” means that your event has been successfully submitted and is now being reviewed by the USAJOBS team. If it is approved, it will be published.


### Why was my event disapproved?

Events are disapproved by the USAJOBS team when they do not follow the event submission guidelines that ensure all events are written in a format that is reflective of the language USAJOBS uses to ensure all content is user-friendly and in <a href="http://www.plainlanguage.gov/">plain language</a>.


### What are the event submission guidelines?

* Your event title should clearly state the federal agency hosting the event.
* Your event description should start off by stating who the event is open to in order to ensure the right people are engaged in your event content.
* Make sure you are writing in <a href="http://www.plainlanguage.gov/">plain language</a> and use terminology that your audience will clearly understand.
* Use spell check to ensure there are no grammar or spelling errors.
* Try to avoid using acronyms, and wherever possible, spell them out so job seekers can clearly understand what you are referring to.
* Try to make your content appealing to your audience, the job seeker - think about what information would be important for them to see at the time.
* If possible, add contact information for people who are interested in the event but cannot attend.
